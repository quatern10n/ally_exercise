# ally_exercise

Thus repository holds the code written for the Unicorn coding exercise (Ally Bank). The solution to the coding exercise requirements. 

As is written in the Coding Exercise Instructions, your Github Repo containing the basic Spring Boot App was cloned, "gs-rest-service", and then My New Code I added to
the "complete" application. Note that: Your code contains 2 Main classes...2 Apps: "initial" and "complete". Thus:  to complete this coding exercise, 
I wrote my java classes in the "complete" subproject directory. Look there for My code.

I developed it in Eclipse STS, an IDE specificially built for developing SpringBoot apps. So, I was able to build and run it. 
It builds without errors, and it runs without errors. I was able to test run it, and it does launch and begin serving.
I also used POSTMAN to hit its new unicorn endpoints, the POST, and the GET endpoints, and I did have successful POSTMAN tests to 
those endpoints using POSTMAN: HTTP200s back, as well as the required JSON response body. I will provide screenshots of those successful POSTMAN tests.

Also:  the successfully working POSTMAN collection will be shared with Ally, so that you can use them to hit the Web Service endpoints and confirm working.

ALso: It was developed using Test Driven Development, via JUnit tests, in the /test dir. That is how I developed it: I wrote the failing test first, in the JUnit
, and then I wrote the necessary code in the classes to make each Unit test pass. All of the JUnit tests can be run as well, and you will see that all the
tests pass.
